*Forced_Phot_All*
- This is the code for doing forced aperture photometry on all of the WISE images. Make sure it is printing nothing but the dataframe and the names of the galaxies and it will only take 1 minute to run through. 
- It has color-color and color-luminosity diagrams as well.

*Forced_Phot_One* 
- the code needed for doing forced photometry on just one 
- the SED plots are also in here.
attempt1 for forced phot.ipynb has some useful stuff in there, it is the spinoff of HowManyInWISE and starts to do the photometry. it is very well organized. some stufff for merging pandas.

*Step 2*
- a mess, mainly stuff on trying to query the WISE databse.

Files Needed:
- make sure you have "Source_Flux_All_Modified_5.csv", as this is the datatable that I used for organizing the correct queries and galaxies.
