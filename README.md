debugging image.ipynb is where the real magic happens. ALL of the useful code for "forced aperture photometry" is there
image downloads.ipynb has some useful stuff in there, it is the spinoff of Step 2 and starts to do the photometry. it is very well organized. some stufff for merging pandas.

step 2 is a mess, mainly stuff on trying to query the WISE databse.



forced_phot_one has the SED in it as well.
